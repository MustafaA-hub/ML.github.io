# Mutual Information
The mutual information (MI) between two quantities is a measure of the extent to which knowledge of one quantity reduces uncertainty about the other. If you knew the value of a feature, how much more confident would you be about the target?

MI can help you to understand the relative potential of a feature as a predictor of the target, considered by itself.
It's possible for a feature to be very informative when interacting with other features, but not so informative all alone. MI can't detect interactions between features. It is a univariate metric.

The actual usefulness of a feature depends on the model you use it with. A feature is only useful to the extent that its relationship with the target is one your model can learn. Just because a feature has a high MI score doesn't mean your model will be able to do anything with that information. You may need to transform the feature first to expose the association.

The scikit-learn algorithm for MI treats discrete features differently from continuous features. Consequently, you need to tell it which are which. Float dtype = continous, Int dtype = discrete. Categoricals (object or categorial dtype) can be treated as discrete by giving them a label encoding.
